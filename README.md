## User Story

## Description

This application allows the user to design their own workouts and save them locally to a weekly calendar that they can access easily throughout their week. The user is first presented with a homepage where they can choose to begin designing their workout by choosing between strength and cardio. Upon selection, the user is taken to different webpage where they can begin selecting exercises. The strength category pulls from the WGER API and allows the user to further customize their experience by choosing which body part they want to focus on that particular day. Once they choose their desired focus, they are presented with 15 randomized options for exercises that they can select using the checkboxes. Once they have selected, the user then selects the day of the week they want to save that workout to. This brings the user to the weekly planner where they can view any saved workouts. 

## Features

* If the user selects Cardio from the homepage, they are presented with options for categories of cardio workouts. They select their desired option and can then select the specific workout to save into their weekly calendar. 

* On the weekly planner page, the user can search for the weather in their city and a 7 day forecast is displayed pulling from the OpenWeatherMap API so that the user can better plan their workouts.

* Breadcrumbs allow the user to easily navigate back to homepage, weekly planner, cardio page, or strength page. A return to top button appears when the user begins to scroll provides a quick way for the user to return to the top of the webpage. 

* Shuffle and slice methods randomize and minimize the amount of data displayed from the API source.
